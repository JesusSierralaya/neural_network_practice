# Neural network course

Repository for storing and progresing the tasks related the UCM course on Neural Network Models

## Task 1

- Reviewing the effects of manipulating learning rates and the principles of activation function.
- Use of Jupyter notebooks and Markdown for documentation.

## Task 2

- Introduction to building neural networks with TensorFlow and Keras.
  - Objective: Achieve high accuracy.
- Convert a Jupyter notebook into a PDF file.

## Task 3

  - Objective: Achieve high accuracy by handling hyperparameters (number of neurons, layers, batch size, optimizer).

## Task 4

- Multilayer perceptron for linear regression.
  - Target: Propose a improved model that maintains the accuracy (R^2) while being faster and structurally simpler.

## Task 5

- Exploring Transfer learning.
- Implementing a Functional MLP activation function.
- Demostrating Data augmentation with examples.

## Task 6
